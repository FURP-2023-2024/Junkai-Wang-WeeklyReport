==========
Week 1
---------
* Project objective <br> 
The project aims to leverage supercapacitors as a technical support solution for electrical applications and project requirements, such as providing power supply in robomaster where the power demand exceeds 40W.<br>

* Basic understanding of SCs
Supercapacitors (SCs) are advanced energy storage devices that can store and release energy rapidly, and they have high power density, quick chargeâ€“discharge time, low input resistance, extended lifetime, and they are environmentally friendly.<br> 

Week 2
---------
*  Supercapacitor controller <br>
