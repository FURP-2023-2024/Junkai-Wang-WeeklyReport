Junkai_Wang Week 3 Report
==========

Week 3
---------
*  Supercapacitor controller Model <br>
First familiarize and study the existing architecture that combines lithium batteries with bidirectional DC/DC converters and supercapacitors in parallel with the DC bus. <br>
Subsequently, this architecture will be modified to connect supercapacitors in series with bidirectional DC/DC converters, while directly paralleling the DC/DC converters with the lithium batteries to the DC bus.

Next step
---------
*  This week and next week I plan to continue studying the existing modeling (still working on it), and try to modify the model according to the needs after fully understanding it.
